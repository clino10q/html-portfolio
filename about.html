<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an aspiring app developer. I'm still learning how to work with flutter, HTML5 and Python.</p>

<p>I'm a tall, dark, skinny dude. I attend Redeemer's University in Ede, Osun. I'm a computer Scince student currently in 300 level and on a 4.02 cgpa hoping to have increased by the time our results drop</p>

<p>I love watching anime in my quiet time. It gives me a peace of mind like nothing does. My favourite anime is Naruto but i also love Kuroko's Basketball a lot</p>
